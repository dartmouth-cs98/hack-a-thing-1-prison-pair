What we did: We experimented with and used javascript to create a small web game.
By randomly generating a map, using Conway's game of life, we center the user and
allow them to explore tunnels. When the user comes across a blue block, they are
greeted with a Jaden Smith tweet and their view of their surroundings are slightly
increased.

Who did what: Two people contributed to this project. Wyatt Prill contributed to
the map generation, minimap create and sounds, as well as player view and shadow. Alexander Sheehan's contribution was focused around cleaning up map generation, text generation,
movement logic and player placement/player view. That being said, both partners worked on varying aspects and components together.

What we learned: This was an experiment with a few concepts. Practicing web development
and javascript was the biggest reason we selected this project idea. We also focused
on working with graphics and animations, using the html canvas'. The project helped
use study callback function, jquery and AJAX. It also was a great lesson in why
Twitter's API is frustrating and annoying to work with.

What didn't work: Getting more time to add some personalized assets would have been
nice. We had also planned to utilize Twitter's API to grab actual tweets, but
it turned out to be far more frustrating that originally thought, so instead we
read from a server side file. Lastly, reading the tweets in the game turned out
to be a little buggy and not perfect. Given more time, we would have made that
more polished.

Tutorials and online sources: Most of what we studied came from www.w3schools.com.
We also took inspiration from 
https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664 in order to make the map generation.
